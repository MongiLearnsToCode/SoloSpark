# Phase 2 and Implementation Plan Alignment Checklist

## Tasks Comparison
- [ ] API routing setup (Next.js API routes or Fastify) matches Step 2 expectations.
- [ ] tRPC implementation for type-safe API calls aligns with Step 2.
- [ ] Prisma connection to Supabase with minimal schema is consistent with Step 2.
- [ ] BullMQ setup with Redis for background jobs matches Step 2 requirements.
- [ ] Authentication middleware using Clerk aligns with Step 2.
- [ ] Logging system with Pino is specified or compatible with Step 2.

## Technology Comparison
- [ ] Next.js API routes or Fastify is an accepted choice in the implementation plan.
- [ ] tRPC is either specified or allowed for API communication.
- [ ] Prisma and Supabase are the expected database tools.
- [ ] BullMQ and Redis are approved for job queuing.
- [ ] Clerk is the designated authentication provider.
- [ ] Pino is an acceptable logging library.

## Deliverables Comparison
- [ ] Functional backend skeleton with API routes is delivered as expected.
- [ ] Secure database interactions via Prisma are achieved.
- [ ] Background job processing with BullMQ is operational.
- [ ] Authentication middleware protects routes as required.
- [ ] Logging system captures necessary events.

## Action Items
- [ ] Review Step 2 of the implementation plan in detail.
- [ ] Identify any discrepancies in tasks, technologies, or deliverables.
- [ ] Adjust Phase 2 document or implementation plan as needed to resolve conflicts.
