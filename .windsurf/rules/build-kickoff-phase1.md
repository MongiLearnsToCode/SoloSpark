# Build Kickoff: SoloSpark MVP Implementation (Phase 1)

## Hello Coding Agent
Weâ€™re kicking off the development of SoloSpark, a streamlined social media management platform designed specifically for solopreneurs. SoloSpark empowers freelancers, influencers, and side-hustlers to schedule posts, track performance, and save time with practical AI toolsâ€”without the complexity of enterprise solutions like Hootsuite or Buffer. Our target user is the "solo chaos gremlin" managing their social media at 2 AM with cold coffee and no patience for friction.

## Quick Context
SoloSpark focuses on simplicity, speed, and affordability, offering a fast, intuitive experience for solopreneurs who need to post smarter, not harder. The MVP will support Instagram, X, and LinkedIn, with core features including post scheduling, a visual calendar, basic analytics, and AI-powered caption suggestions.

## This Phaseâ€™s Objective
**Goal:** Establish the foundational infrastructure for SoloSpark, including a deployable development environment, authentication, CI/CD, and a basic scheduling proof-of-concept. This aligns with Step 1 of the Implementation Plan: "Foundation."

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui  
- **Backend:** Next.js API routes  
- **Jobs:** BullMQ + Upstash Redis  
- **Database:** Supabase + Prisma  
- **Auth:** Clerk  
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions + Vercel  

## Tasks
- [ ] Set up a Next.js project with the following structure:  
  - `/pages` â†’ Next.js pages and API routes  
  - `/components` â†’ Reusable React components, organized by feature  
  - `/hooks` â†’ Custom React hooks  
  - `/lib` â†’ Utility functions, API wrappers, business logic  
  - `/styles` â†’ Global styles or CSS modules  
  - `/public` â†’ Static assets  
- [ ] Install ESLint, Prettier, Husky, and commit hooks for code quality.  
- [ ] Configure Tailwind CSS and integrate shadcn/ui components.  
- [ ] Set up API routes for the backend within `/pages/api`.  
- [ ] Set up Prisma and connect to Supabase for database management.  
- [ ] Integrate Clerk for authentication and ensure login/logout flows work.  
- [ ] Configure BullMQ with Upstash Redis and implement a dummy job that logs a message to the console after a 10-second delay.  
- [ ] Set up CI/CD with GitHub Actions to run linter and tests on pull requests, and deploy to Vercel.  
- [ ] Add placeholder files: `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `.env.example`.  

## Definition of Done
- Login and signup are functional via Clerk.  
- Logged-in users can access a protected `/api/ping` route.  
- A background job queue logs a scheduled post to the console after a 10-second delay.  
- CI pipeline runs linter and tests on pull requests.  
- Project deploys successfully on Vercel.  

## Known Constraints
- LinkedIn API approval may be delayedâ€”mock its integration for now, as per the PRD's risk mitigation strategy.  
- Post publishing will be stubbed until full platform access is granted.  
- AI captioning is not required yet; just wire the endpoint.  

## Where to Ask Questions / Share Updates
Log any questions, issues, or progress updates in the project documentation or the designated communication channel.

## Tone Guidelines
- Prioritize speed and simplicity over flexibilityâ€”this is an MVP.  
- Avoid overengineering features not critical for launch.  
- Build for clarity and ease, like a tool a sleep-deprived user can navigate.

## Agent Instruction
Begin with Task 1. Output the proposed folder structure before proceeding. Confirm the login flow is functional before moving on to background job setup.
