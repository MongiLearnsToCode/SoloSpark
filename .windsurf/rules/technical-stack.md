## 1. Overview

**Goal**: Build a lean, scalable, user-friendly scheduling tool with AI-powered captions, scheduling optimization, and insightsâ€”tailored for solopreneurs who demand speed and simplicity.

**Principles**:

- **Simple > Overengineered**: Prioritize practical solutions to hit MVP goals quickly.  
- **Speed > Flexibility**: Focus on low latency and fast iteration.  
- **Familiar > Fancy**: Use proven tools with strong ecosystems.  
- **Serverless/Managed**: Minimize ops with managed services.  
- **Replaceable Components**: Make AI and APIs swappable.
